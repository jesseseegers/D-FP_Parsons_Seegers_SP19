## **Future Bio**

Submit via email it to me via Slack Direct Message **as a PDF,** and make sure to **name the file like so: lastname, firstname_future bio.pdf**

- Write a 200-500 word bio, in third person (he/she/they), imagining your professional and personal accomplishments 30 years from now, in 2049. Some questions to think about and include in your description:
  - The kinds of work you will have completed
  - Collaborations with other people/companies
  - Do you have a specialty?
  - Have you won any awards or recognitions? If so, which ones?
  - Do you have notable clients, and if so, who are they?
  - Have you had exhibitions of your work?
  - Has your work been published anywhere, in books, magazines, blogs, etc.?
- Here are some reference examples to get you thinking:
  - 2x4: Michael Rock, Susan Sellers, Georgianna Stout: <http://2x4.org/people/>
  - Milton Glaser (note the short, intermediate and long versions): <http://www.miltonglaser.com/milton/#0>
