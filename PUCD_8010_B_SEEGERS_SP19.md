# Syllabus

### Course Overview

This course is specifically designed to serve as a broad foundation for students to give form to content. This is a hands-on studio course that will begin with projects that investigate typography, book and pamphlet design, digital printing, content on the web, and ideation. Contemporary issues that cross design and publishing are discussed through a series of readings and analysis of contemporary books, magazines, and periodicals across both printed and digital platforms. Students work individually and in multidisciplinary teams towards creating conceptual publishing projects that straddle disciplines of design and publishing, with a particular focus on the relationship between form and content.

The seminar will be the underpinning of a hands-on studio course, where students will get a working introduction to typography, image, layout, sequence, and order, with the aim to design and publish in interdisciplinary teams, both printed and digital, by the end of the semester. This class is a good moment to think about how design can respond to an external system (in this case, publishing) in its totality, and go beyond the visual in concept. We will ground our discussions in how publishing accomplishes its functions of *Filtering, Framing, and Amplifying*. We will discuss the transition of the role of a designer from giving form to content, to giving/considering *context* in relation to both form *and* content



### Learning Outcomes

- At the end of this course, students will be able to:
  - Articulate the historical and contemporary role of design
    in publishing content in print and online
  - Demonstrate comprehensive awareness of design
    systems, critical thinking, and cultural awareness
  - Develop platform-independent design concepts
  - Demonstrate basic abilities to form content through
    typography, image, layout, sequence and order
  - Assess and incorporate feedback as part of an iterative
    design and publishing process
  - Offer constructive feedback for others’ work
  - Demonstrate an understanding of how design can respond to an external system (in this case, publishing) in its totality, going beyond the visual in concept.

## Projects & Assignments

### Project 1: Medium/Audience Translation & Augmentation

- Using a literary work in the public domain (see [Are.na channel resources](https://www.are.na/jesse-seegers/public-domain-harv2p3hkcw)) translate and augment the inherited content by designing a publication for a new edition in a digital format
  - Consider: Illustrations, interactivity, **audience**, time (!), how interactivity and time relate to one another, **how the new form can relate to a new audience today**
  - Content of the work must be tied to the translation and the augmentation must be related in some way to both the content and the form
  - Augmentation examples:
    - images (from public domain)
    - form elements (questionnaire, fill in blank)
    - media embeds (related posts from other media platforms (Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, Google Maps, etc.)
    - textual, from other sources, i.e. footnotes, annotation, marginalia
  - Schedule:
    - Week 2: Announce & Introduce Project
    - Week 5: 1st Draft Group Pin-Up
    - Week 7: Draft 2 peer-to-peer review
    - Week 8: Final file/link due (midterm)



### Project 2: Post-Artifact (digital/screen) Publication Design & Dispersion↔Post-Artifact Artifact

Find a born-digital web-native publication and bring it into a physical format as a means of preserving it for after the (imaginary?) media apocalypse.

- Identify a native-digital publication (construed in the broadest possible sense) experience which you think would benefit in some creative way from being brought offline
- Create a physical artifact publication output from the born-digital publication, considering:
  - To what extent is the visual character of each similar or different?
  - What is lost? Either through media-specific limitations or intentional choice
  - To what extent are the distribution mechanisms similar or different? Make a diagram distilling means of distribution similarity/difference
  - Parsing video or audio content
- Content Ideas:
  - A Website that hasn't been used/updated in a long time (an out-of-commission blog, for example)
    - e.g. History of the World timeline (long scroll bar navigation)
  - Audio/Visual content - how do you archive in a physical form
    - Open transcripts (look up)
    - what can you do with a transcript that you can't do with the video
  - add an analytical layer?
- Technical Components:
  - Design using the program/tool of your choice
  - Use a digital-native workflow to output a print-native artifact
- Schedule
  - Week 9, March 27: Introduce Project
  - Week 11, April 10: Draft 1: peer-to-peer review in small groups
  - Week 13, April 24: Draft 2: group critique
  - Week 15, May 8: Final review with guest critics (final class)

**Qualitative Grading Overview**

Each student will be judged on the quality, experimentation, and improvement that their work shows.



A. Excellent (90-100)

Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands the theory and practice behind visual foundation.



B. Very Good / Good (80-89)

Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average understanding of visual foundation theory & practice.



C. Satisfactory (70-79)

Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of visual foundation theory & practice.



D. Poor; Below Average (60-69)

Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of visual foundation. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and poor craft.



F. Unacceptable (59 & Below)

## Department and Class Policies, Procedures, Etc.



### Student Responsibilities and Participation 

Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent. Late assignments, failure to complete the assignments for class discussion and/or critique, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions, presentations and/or critiques will jeopardize your successful completion of this course. Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, assignments, projects, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time. Practice being present. Some guidelines: 

1. Treat class time as an opportunity. 
2. Be respectful toward your classmates. 
3. Be respectful towards visitors and critics. Their impression of your manner affects you and your peers. 
4. Complete assignments and readings on time. 
5. Participate in class discussions and critiques. Listen when someone is talking, and offer constructive support. 
6. Disruptive behavior is not tolerated. If you are disruptive, you will be given one warning, and then you will be asked to leave the classroom. 
7. Be present. **Drifting into your phone, tablet, or laptop is not acceptable,** and is highly disruptive.   



### Attendance 

Attendance is part of being present. If you are absent more than four times, you will fail this course. Being late 3 times is the equivalent of one absence. Following two absences, you may be asked to speak with your advisor to review any impediments to their successful performance in class and, if so, to provide confirmation to me that such a conversation took place. 

*Religious Absences and Equivalent Opportunity*
Pursuant to Section 224-a of the New York State Education Laws, any student who is absent from school because of his or her religious beliefs will be given an equivalent opportunity to register for classes or make up any examination, study, or work requirements which he or she may have missed because of such absence on any particular day or days. The student must inform the instructor at the beginning of the course of any anticipated absences due to religious observance.



### Electronic Devices

**Please bring your laptop with you for each class session.** This is for studio work only: you may not take notes with your laptop. In fact, I prefer you do not take notes at all. If you wish, you may record class sessions for later review. _**No other use of your phone is permitted!**_



### Academic Honesty and Integrity  

The New School views “academic honesty and integrity” as the duty of every member of an academic community to claim authorship for his or her own work and only for that work, and to recognize the contributions of others accurately and completely. This obligation is fundamental to the integrity of intellectual debate, and creative and academic pursuits. Academic honesty and integrity includes accurate use of quotations, as well as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or any aspect of the work of others (including that of faculty members and other students). Academic dishonesty results from infractions of this “accurate use.” The standards of academic honesty and integrity, and citation of sources, apply to all forms of academic work, including submissions of drafts of final papers or projects. All members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in accord with the standards of academic honesty and integrity.  

It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others. Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.



### Guidelines for Written Assignments 

Plagiarism is the use of another person’s words or ideas in any academic work using books, journals, internet postings, or other student papers without proper acknowledgment. For further information on proper acknowledgment and plagiarism, including expectations for paraphrasing source material and proper forms of citation in research and writing, students should consult the Chicago Manual of Style (cf. Turabian, 6th edition). The University Writing Center also provides useful on-line resources to help students understand and avoid plagiarism. See https://www.newschool.edu/university-learning-center/avoiding-plagiarism.pdf. 

Students must receive prior permission from instructors to submit the same or substantially overlapping material for two different assignments. Submission of the same work for two assignments without the prior permission of instructors is plagiarism.



### Guidelines for Design Projects

Work from other visual sources may be imitated or incorporated into your design work **if** the fact of imitation or incorporation and the identity of the original source are properly acknowledged. There must be no intent to deceive; the work must make clear that it emulates or comments on the source as a source. Referencing a style or concept in otherwise original work does not constitute plagiarism. The originality of studio work that presents itself as “in the manner of” or as playing with “variations on” a particular source should be evaluated by the individual faculty member in the context of a critique.  

Incorporating ready-made materials into student design work as in a collage, synthesized photograph or paste-up is not plagiarism in the educational context. In the commercial world, however, such appropriation is prohibited by copyright laws and may result in legal consequences.



### Student Disability Services (SDS)

In keeping with the University’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to meet with the Office of Student Disability Services, who will conduct an intake, and if appropriate, provide an academic accommodation notification letter to you to bring to me. SDS assists students with disabilities in need of academic and programmatic accommodations as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. For more information and resources, please see https://www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/
