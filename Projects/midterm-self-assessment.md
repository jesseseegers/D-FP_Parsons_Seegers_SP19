# MIDTERM SELF ASSESSMENT  

**Send your midterm self assessment to me as a PDF via a Slack Direct Message.**

Critically analyze/evaluate your visual foundation process and how it is has changed over the course of the semester. Responses should be roughly  1-2 pages, single spaced. 

* What are you learning? 
* How are your learning?
* What qualitative description would you give your process and why? (i.e. excellent, very good, good, needs improvement etc.)
* What qualitative description would you give the execution of your project and why?
* Is there something you thought we would learn but have not yet?
